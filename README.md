# React 101 Introduction Lecture for Gokstad Akademiet.
 
****
This is an introduction lecture to React.js for students at Gokstad Akademiet. The Purpose with this is to create a gentle "only-need-to-know" talk to make it easier entering the realm of React. There are many topics that are very "dummed down" for the sole intention of making it easier to learn a very complex library, so take it all with a pinch of salt - as they say.

Disclaimer: this is my essentially my take and what I deem as a good approach, but that doesn't mean there aren't better/other approaches out there. 

Enjoy and happy learning!
